# GT-FinTech-Research-Project
**This is my submission to the initial tasks for the research position at the Georgia Institute of Technology Financial Technologies Lab

Company 10-K Analysis App

This Flask web application allows users to download and analyze financial data from SEC 10-K filings of public companies and generate insights on revenue growth and price-to-earnings ratio using OpenAI's LLM API. The insights are visualized using Matplotlib.

For Task 1.2, I decided to utilize the OpenAI LLM API to generate the specific insights of Price-To-Earning ratios and revenue growth charts. Price-to-Earning Ratios are crucial to helping investors determine the market value of a stock as compared to the company's earnings and revenue growth is crucial to helping investors provide insights into the financial stability of a stock.

For Task 2, I decided to utilize Flask because its simplicity and suitability for smaller python projects provides just the right amount of functionality without unnecessary overhead. It allows you to quickly develop and deploy a functional web application straight from python libraries without getting bogged down by unnecessary complexity.

I have detailed the reasons for each section of code under comments giving logic as to why I coded what I coded and how it will be used. Additionally, I embedded HTML code instead of separate HTML files to assist the use of Flask for ease of grading in the final submission of code.
